# E.-coli-Min-system-1D-simulation
Randomly produced 4 rate constants to have all positive particle number and pass linear stability analysis and have Min oscillation in one dimensional lattice.

# Description

1. Six python 3.9 scripts are available in this repository.

# Instructions

1. run c1.Min.LSA.random.para.py to get one parameter set.
2. with the parameter set produced in the last step, get timecourse simulation by running c2.get.timecourse.py
3. c3.kymograph.py produces a figure
4. c4.lamba.py produce a figure as lambda value vs cell length
5. c5.Iratio.py produce a figure as Iratio vs cell length
6. c6.period.py produce a figure as oscillation preiod vs cell length
